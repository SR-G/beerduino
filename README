BEERDUINO is a small arduino project.
Designed to read various Dallas DS18B20 sensors (on a 1wire bus).
The program is designed to run on Arduino Board + Ethernet Shield.
Reads multiple sensors temperatures.
Embed a small web-server able to load simple HTML page and XML page with the temperature values.
Can send a mail if temperature limits are reached.

Use a few libraries :
- OneWire (v2) 
- Webduino
- Serial
- DallasTemperature
